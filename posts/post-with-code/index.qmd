## Introduction

Age classification is crucial for efficient healthcare planning and resource allocation. Accurately differentiating between "Seniors" (65 years and older) and "Adults" (under 65 years) allows for better-targeted interventions and evidence-based policy decisions. However, traditional methods often fail to account for individual differences within these groups. To address this, we developed a logistic regression model to predict an individualâ€™s age group based on various health and lifestyle factors.

We utilized data from the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014**, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This dataset provides a rich foundation for applying machine learning techniques to public health and demographic research. The full report is available on our [GitHub repository](https://ubc-mds.github.io/DSCI522-2425-group31_age-group-prediction/reports/age_prediction_report.html).

## Methods and Analysis

### Dataset Overview

The NHANES 2013-2014 dataset includes a diverse range of health-related variables. For this study, we focused on a subset of features related to age prediction:

- **RIDAGEYR**: Age in years.
- **RIAGENDR**: Gender (1: Male, 2: Female).
- **PAQ605**: Weekly physical activity (1: Yes, 2: No).
- **BMXBMI**: Body Mass Index (BMI).
- **LBXGLU**: Fasting blood glucose levels.
- **DIQ010**: Diabetes status (1: Yes, 2: No, 3: Borderline).
- **LBXGLT**: Oral glucose tolerance test results.
- **LBXIN**: Blood insulin levels.

The target variable, `age_group`, categorized respondents as "Adult" or "Senior." A significant class imbalance was present, with 84% of respondents labeled as "Adult" and only 16% as "Senior." This imbalance required careful handling during model training to ensure balanced performance.

### Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Preprocessing Steps

1. **Feature Selection and Cleaning**:
   - Removed non-informative columns, such as respondent IDs.
   - Mapped categorical variables (e.g., gender and diabetes status) to readable labels.

2. **Handling Missing Data**:
   - Excluded entries with implausible or missing values, particularly in physical activity responses.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Standardized numerical features to ensure consistency.
   - Encoded categorical variables:
     - Ordinal encoding for ordered categories like diabetes status.
     - One-hot encoding for nominal categories like gender.

#### Exploratory Insights

Exploratory analysis revealed several notable patterns. The imbalance in the target variable emphasized the importance of stratified sampling during train-test splits. Additionally, a heatmap of feature correlations (below) highlighted key relationships, such as a moderate correlation between BMI and fasting glucose levels.

These insights informed feature selection and guided model development.

## Model Definition and Optimization

### Logistic Regression

Logistic regression was selected for its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability in binary classification tasks. This model predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a specific class, making it well-suited for distinguishing between "Adults" and "Seniors."

### Model Pipeline

The modeling pipeline included the following steps:

1. **Data Scaling**: Ensured uniformity by standardizing numerical features.
2. **Encoding**: Transformed categorical variables into numerical representations.
3. **Model Training**: Used balanced class weights to address the target variable's imbalance.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized the regularization parameter `C` using cross-validation, enhancing model performance.

### Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix provided further insights into the model's performance:

While the model performed well for the majority class (Adults), its performance on the minority class (Seniors) was less satisfactory due to the inherent class imbalance.

## Discussion

### Strengths

1. **Baseline Model**: Logistic regression serves as a reliable baseline for more advanced models.
2. **Interpretability**: Coefficients offer valuable insights into feature importance and prediction mechanisms.
3. **Reproducibility**: Stratified sampling and a fixed random seed ensure consistent and reliable results.

### Limitations

1. **Class Imbalance**: Despite using balanced class weights, the model struggled to predict the minority class accurately. Techniques like SMOTE or oversampling could improve performance.
2. **Threshold Sensitivity**: The default decision threshold of 0.5 may not be ideal. Adjusting this threshold could improve recall for the "Senior" category.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Incorporating derived features, such as age-to-BMI ratios, could enhance predictive power.

## Future Work

To address the limitations, we propose the following:

1. **Feature Engineering**: Explore new features derived from existing data.
2. **Algorithm Comparison**: Evaluate alternative models, such as K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines.
3. **Advanced Tuning**: Apply randomized search or Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning.
4. **Threshold Analysis**: Experiment with different classification thresholds to improve recall for the minority class.

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates the feasibility of using logistic regression to classify age groups based on health survey data. While the model provides a strong foundation, there is significant room for improvement. Future iterations will focus on addressing class imbalance, refining feature engineering, and exploring advanced models to achieve more robust performance. These efforts underscore the value of data-driven approaches in public health and demographic research.
