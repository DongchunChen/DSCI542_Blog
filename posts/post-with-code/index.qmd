# Introduction

Understanding age classification is vital for efficient healthcare resource allocation and planning. Accurately distinguishing between "Senior" (65 years and older) and "Adult" (under 65 years) populations enables targeted interventions and policy formulations. Traditional methods often lack the precision required to address individual differences within these groups. To bridge this gap, we developed a logistic regression model aimed at predicting an individual's age group based on various health and lifestyle factors.

We utilized data from the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014**, a program conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that collects extensive health and nutritional information from a diverse U.S. population. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} This dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for applying machine learning techniques to demographic and healthcare research.

# Methods and Analysis

## Dataset Overview

The NHANES 2013-2014 dataset encompasses a wide array of health-related variables. For our analysis, we focused on a subset pertinent to age prediction, including:

- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: A measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- **Blood Glucose Levels**: Including fasting glucose and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results, indicative of metabolic health.
- **Insulin Levels**: Reflective of pancreatic function and insulin sensitivity.
- **Physical Activity**: Self-reported data on engagement in vigorous work activity.
- **Diabetes Diagnosis**: Self-reported history of diabetes, providing context to glucose and insulin metrics.

The target variable, `age_group`, was categorized as "Adult" or "Senior." Notably, the dataset exhibited an imbalance, with approximately 84% labeled as "Adult" and 16% as "Senior." This imbalance necessitated careful consideration during model development to ensure equitable performance across both classes.

## Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Preprocessing Steps

1. **Feature Selection and Cleaning**:
   - Excluded non-informative columns such as respondent sequence numbers.
   - Mapped categorical variables to human-readable labels (e.g., gender coded as "Male" or "Female").

2. **Handling Missing and Erroneous Data**:
   - Removed entries with missing or implausible values, particularly in physical activity responses.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Standardized numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance, facilitating model convergence.
   - Encoded categorical variables appropriately:
     - Applied ordinal encoding for ordered categories, such as diabetes status.
     - Utilized one-hot encoding for nominal categories, like gender.

### Exploratory Insights

Initial exploratory data analysis revealed correlations between certain features and age groups. For instance, higher BMI and elevated blood glucose levels were more prevalent in the "Senior" category. These insights informed feature selection and underscored the importance of each variable in predicting age groups.

# Model Definition and Optimization

We selected logistic regression for its interpretability and efficiency in binary classification tasks. This model estimates the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class, making it suitable for distinguishing between "Adult" and "Senior" groups.

### Model Pipeline

The modeling pipeline comprised the following steps:

- **Data Scaling**: Standardized numerical features to ensure uniformity.
- **Encoding**: Transformed categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for the model.
- **Model Training**: Implemented logistic regression with balanced class weights to address the dataset's class imbalance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employed cross-validation to optimize the regularization parameter `C`, enhancing the model's generalization capabilities.

# Results

Our logistic regression model achieved the following performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**: 73%
- **Macro F1 Score**: 0.61

The confusion matrix provided further insights:

- Correctly classified 370 "Adults" and 48 "Seniors."
- Misclassified 152 cases overall.

# Discussion and Next Steps

While the model's performance is promising, there are avenues for improvement:

1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Incorporate interaction terms or external datasets to enrich the feature set.

2. **Threshold Adjustment**:
   - Explore different classification thresholds to better capture "Senior" predictions.

3. **Model Exploration**:
   - Evaluate alternative algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Classifiers, to benchmark against logistic regression.

### Implications

Enhanced age group classification models can significantly improve healthcare strategies and resource allocation, particularly for seniors managing chronic conditions.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of logistic regression in demographic analysis. By refining our approach through feature engineering and exploring advanced models, we aim to boost prediction accuracy and contribute to more effective public health planning.
