    "text": "Understanding age classification is vital for efficient healthcare resource allocation and planning. Accurately distinguishing between “Senior” (65 years and older) and “Adult” (under 65 years) populations enables targeted interventions and policy formulations. Traditional methods often lack the precision required to address individual differences within these groups. To bridge this gap, we developed a logistic regression model aimed at predicting an individual’s age group based on various health and lifestyle factors.\nWe utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014, a program conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that collects extensive health and nutritional information from a diverse U.S. population. :contentReferenceoaicite:0 This dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for applying machine learning techniques to demographic and healthcare research."

    "text": "Dataset Overview\nThe NHANES 2013-2014 dataset encompasses a wide array of health-related variables. For our analysis, we focused on a subset pertinent to age prediction, including:\n\nBody Mass Index (BMI): A measure of body fat based on height and weight.\nBlood Glucose Levels: Including fasting glucose and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results, indicative of metabolic health.\nInsulin Levels: Reflective of pancreatic function and insulin sensitivity.\nPhysical Activity: Self-reported data on engagement in vigorous work activity.\nDiabetes Diagnosis: Self-reported history of diabetes, providing context to glucose and insulin metrics.\n\nThe target variable, age_group, was categorized as “Adult” or “Senior.” Notably, the dataset exhibited an imbalance, with approximately 84% labeled as “Adult” and 16% as “Senior.” This imbalance necessitated careful consideration during model development to ensure equitable performance across both classes."

For instance, higher BMI and elevated blood glucose levels were more prevalent in the “Senior” category. These insights informed feature selection and underscored the importance of each variable in predicting age groups."
