    "text": "Methods and Analysis\n\nDataset Overview\nThe NHANES 2013-2014 dataset includes a diverse range of health-related variables. For this study, we focused on a subset of features related to age prediction:\n\nRIDAGEYR: Age in years.\nRIAGENDR: Gender (1: Male, 2: Female).\nPAQ605: Weekly physical activity (1: Yes, 2: No).\nBMXBMI: Body Mass Index (BMI).\nLBXGLU: Fasting blood glucose levels.\nDIQ010: Diabetes status (1: Yes, 2: No, 3: Borderline).\nLBXGLT: Oral glucose tolerance test results.\nLBXIN: Blood insulin levels.\n\nThe target variable, age_group, categorized respondents as “Adult” or “Senior.” A significant class imbalance was present, with 84% of respondents labeled as “Adult” and only 16% as “Senior.” This imbalance required careful handling during model training to ensure balanced performance.\n\n\nData Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nPreprocessing Steps\n\nFeature Selection and Cleaning:\n\nRemoved non-informative columns, such as respondent IDs.\nMapped categorical variables (e.g., gender and diabetes status) to readable labels.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\n\nExcluded entries with implausible or missing values, particularly in physical activity responses.\n\nData Transformation:\n\nStandardized numerical features to ensure consistency.\nEncoded categorical variables:\n\nOrdinal encoding for ordered categories like diabetes status.\nOne-hot encoding for nominal categories like gender.\n\n\n\n\n\nExploratory Insights\nExploratory analysis revealed several notable patterns. The imbalance in the target variable emphasized the importance of stratified sampling during train-test splits. Additionally, a heatmap of feature correlations (below) highlighted key relationships, such as a moderate correlation between BMI and fasting glucose levels.\n \nThese insights informed feature selection and guided model development."

This model predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a specific class, making it well-suited for distinguishing between “Adults” and “Seniors.”\n\n\nModel Pipeline\nThe modeling pipeline included the following steps:\n\nData Scaling: Ensured uniformity by standardizing numerical features.\nEncoding: Transformed categorical variables into numerical representations.\nModel Training: Used balanced class weights to address the target variable’s imbalance.\nHyperparameter Tuning: Optimized the regularization parameter C using cross-validation, enhancing model performance."

    "text": "Discussion\n\nStrengths\n\nBaseline Model: Logistic regression serves as a reliable baseline for more advanced models.\nInterpretability: Coefficients offer valuable insights into feature importance and prediction mechanisms.\nReproducibility: Stratified sampling and a fixed random seed ensure consistent and reliable results.\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\nClass Imbalance: Despite using balanced class weights, the model struggled to predict the minority class accurately. Techniques like SMOTE or oversampling could improve performance.\nThreshold Sensitivity: The default decision threshold of 0.5 may not be ideal. Adjusting this threshold could improve recall for the “Senior” category.\nFeature Engineering: Incorporating derived features, such as age-to-BMI ratios, could enhance predictive power."
